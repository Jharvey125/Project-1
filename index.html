        <p>Meditation is a practice which has been followed for many years, teaching others techniques
            in order to relax as well as to find enlightenment. When we look back into the roots of medication, we can
            find two main origins being in India and China as far back as 1500 BCE. A commonly known form of
            spirituality in which practises these mediation techniques as a part of their daily life is Buddhism, this
            religion was originated in indie and quickly spread through Asia in which fellow practisers used meditation
            as a form of finding ones way to peace and enlightenment by quieting the mind and tuning in with their own
            body and chakras, all of which originated from their figure called Buddha who spent many hours each day
            finding his way to this mindset of deeper consciousness. Furthermore, when we look into meditation, we can
            see its many benefits which have been scientifically proven to help others relive themselves of stress,
            anxiety and even help those suffering with depression. If you find yourself wanting to reach a higher
            version of yourself and help improve your state of mind, then beginning your meditation journey is the best
            place for you to start.</p>
