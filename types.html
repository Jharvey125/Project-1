            <p class="meditation-types">
                Mindfulness meditation is when we pay close attention to all thoughts that are passing through our
                mind
                good, bad maybe even intrusive however, we don’t sit and judge them or allow ourselves to let them
                in we
                simply watch them and take note and compassion into how we are feeling, in which combines our
                concentration
                with a deeper awareness of our consciousness.
            </p>

            <h2 class="types-heading">spiritual meditation</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="meditation-types">
                Spiritual mediation is ideal for those who are wanting to grow deeper into their faith and grow a
                stronger
                connection to their higher power, this can be practised amongst multiple religions for example:
                Christian
                contemplative prayer and Jewish kabbalistic practises. During of which we sit and let ourselves seek
                God
                through contemplation and solitude.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="types-heading">focused meditation</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="meditation-types">
                Focused mediation is as obvious as it sounds, while we meditate, we focus upon something of which
                requires
                us to use one of our five senses. For example, you may close your eyes and listened to the sound of
                a
                gong
                or watch a candle flame and its movements while counting our breathes and calming/quieting the mind.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="types-heading">movement meditation</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="meditation-types">
                Mediation doesn’t mean just sitting down and focusing on our breathes, we can also mediate through
                moving
                our body. You may want to go for a walk-in nature and while doing so you can meditate through
                focusing
                on
                the things around such as the sound of the birds in order to quiet the mind and push away
                negativity.
                Furthermore, you can get yourself involved in tai chi which as a traditional Chinese practice where
                you
                use
                slow, gentle movements to get the body going as well as to relax you.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, if this doesn’t suit you there’s other options such as:

                <li>Gardening</li>
                <li>Art</li>
                <li>Qi gong</li>
                <li>yogo</li>
                <li>Ect...</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2 class="types-heading">visualization meditation</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="meditation-types">
                Visualization meditation is used for us to enhance the feelings of relaxation and calmness by
                closing
                our
                eyes and visualising scenes which are positive, we also ensure that we use out 5 senses; touch,
                smell,
                sight, hearing and taste in order to make these visualisations more vivid in turn inducing a
                stronger
                effect. For example, you may find yourself happiest and calmest at the beach so you sit and picture
                yourself
                there, what does the ocean sound like? can you feel the sand beneath you? can you tase the saltiness
                of
                the
                water in the air? All of these are amazing to enhance calmness and improve your focus and motivation
                as
                well
                as lead you to inner peace.
