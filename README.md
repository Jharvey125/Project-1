## The types page

- The types page is for all the types of meditation and shows us that their are lots of ways to meditate. Everyone is differnt and some people have more time than others, it also gives people to try different ways when feeling differnt things.
- This page is very simplistic, it shows a lotus flower which symbolize resurrections and new beginnings. giving people the hope of a new start.
- The page then has a breif description of each meditation type.


## Get involved

- The first thing that happens when landing on this page is a video will start to play along with some audio.
- The video shows a women breathing, this is to show people what they can do. the video can be paused if users dont want to watch it.
- The audio file is a 3 minute video about controled breathing, this can help people relax. The video can be paused or muted by the user.
- At the end of the page is a feedback form, this is so we can help users have a website that helps them by taking in feedback. 

## Footer

- The footer shows muiltple ways users can find more help on social media.
- The footer has links to facebook, twitter, instagram and youtube. All social media links open in a new tab. This is so users dont lose the lets meditate website.

## Testing

- I have tested this website in other browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft edge and Safari.

- My navigation is clear and easy to understand. users can read the logo and all page names because the text colour is clear against the black background.

- The form works and requires entry in every field, and will require a valid email address. The submit button also works.

## Bugs

(Fixed bugs)

- When i first coded the footer the link wouldnt open in a new tab.

- This was due to me forgetting to add the target = _blank attribute.

- By adding this everything worked as intended.

## Validator Testing

- HTML: no errors found when checking using the offical W3C validator.

- CSS: no errors were found when validating through the official (jigsaw) validator.

- Accessibility: I ran all my code throught the dev tool lighthouse.
