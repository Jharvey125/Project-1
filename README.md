## Testing

- I have tested this website in other browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft edge and Safari.

- My navigation is clear and easy to understand. users can read the logo and all page names because the text colour is clear against the black background.

- The form works and requires entry in every field, and will require a valid email address. The submit button also works.

- i have tested my website on other devices to see how my website functions.
## Bugs

(Fixed bugs)

- When i first coded the footer the link wouldnt open in a new tab.

- This was due to me forgetting to add the target = _blank attribute.

- By adding this everything worked as intended.

## Validator Testing

- HTML: no errors found when checking using the offical [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- CSS: no errors were found when validating through the official [(jigsaw) validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

- Accessibility: I ran all my code throught the dev tool lighthouse.

- Currently works for screen size width: 320px, 360, 800px and 1000px

## Unfixed bugs

couldnt style checkboxes to have a orange border or orange tick.

There are limited media queries so doesnt fit all screen sizes.

## Furture updates

In a future update i would:

- Add large screen size media queries.
- Add more media queries to allow for more devices.
- I will expand my form to get more feedback from users.
- Some file sizes are large so i will find images that are not as big.
- i will also work on the performance of my website as it scored the lowest in lighthouse.
